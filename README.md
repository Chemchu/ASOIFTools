# dice_roller app
So, this is the Bun version using Elysia. The idea is to create a basic dice roller app and serve it on Flyio
The cool part is to also serve it as a PWA and allow users to download it and use it offline.

# Elysia with Bun runtime

## Getting Started
To get started with this template, simply paste this command into your terminal:
